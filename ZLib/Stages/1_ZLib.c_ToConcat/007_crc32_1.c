/*
  Note on the use of DYNAMIC_CRC_TABLE: there is no mutex or semaphore
  protection on the static variables used to control the first-use generation
  of the crc tables. Therefore, if you #define DYNAMIC_CRC_TABLE, you should
  first call get_crc_table() to initialize the tables before allowing more than
  one thread to use crc32().

  MAKECRCH can be #defined to write out crc32.h. A main() routine is also
  produced, so that this one source file can be compiled to an executable.

 /*
  A CRC of a message is computed on N braids of words in the message, where
  each word consists of W bytes (4 or 8). If N is 3, for example, then three
  running sparse CRCs are calculated respectively on each braid, at these
  indices in the array of words: 0, 3, 6, ..., 1, 4, 7, ..., and 2, 5, 8, ...
  This is done starting at a word boundary, and continues until as many blocks
  of N * W bytes as are available have been processed. The results are combined
  into a single CRC at the end. For this code, N must be in the range 1..6 and
  W must be 4 or 8. The upper limit on N can be increased if desired by adding
  more #if blocks, extending the patterns apparent in the code. In addition,
  crc32.h would need to be regenerated, if the maximum N value is increased.

  N and W are chosen empirically by benchmarking the execution time on a given
  processor. The choices for N and W below were based on testing on Intel Kaby
  Lake i7, AMD Ryzen 7, ARM Cortex-A57, Sparc64-VII, PowerPC POWER9, and MIPS64
  Octeon II processors. The Intel, AMD, and ARM processors were all fastest
  with N=5, W=8. The Sparc, PowerPC, and MIPS64 were all fastest at N=5, W=4.
  They were all tested with either gcc or clang, all using the -O3 optimization
  level. Your mileage may vary.
